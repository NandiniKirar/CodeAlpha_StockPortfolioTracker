# Stock PortFolio Tracker

In this tracker, users input the stock names and quantities they own. The program then uses a hardcoded dictionary of stock prices (e.g., {"AAPL": 180, "TSLA": 250}) to compute the total investment value. Optionally, the results can be saved in a .txt or .csv file for future reference.

## Features

-  Track multiple stocks with their quantities
- Predefined stock prices for popular companies (AAPL, TSLA, MSFT, GOOGL, AMZN)
- Real-time calculation of individual stock values and total portfolio value
- Input validation to ensure data integrity
